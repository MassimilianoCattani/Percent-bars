# Betting Game
This is a modified version of percent-bars file. More functions have been implemented.
It is a game where the user bets some money (insert an int), selects an option and check the results.
If user option has the higher number: prize = bet * 10, second: prize = bet * 2, third: prize = bet, others: nothing.
